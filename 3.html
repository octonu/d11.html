<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system
or a private network inside a computer. Simply put, it is the unauthorised
<u>access</u> to or control over computer network security systems for some illicit purpose
Description: To better describe hacking, one needs to first understand hackers.
One can easily assume them to be intelligent and highly skilled in computers.
 In fact, breaking a security system requires more intelligence and expertise than actually creating one.
 There are no hard and fast rules whereby we can categorize hackers into neat compartments.

  Google App Engine (often referred to as GAE or simply App Engine) is a web framework and cloud computing platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers. Applications are sandboxed and run across multiple servers.[1] App Engine offers automatic scaling for web applications—as the number of requests increases for an application, App Engine automatically allocates more resources for the web application to handle the additional demand.[2]

Google App Engine is free up to a certain level of consumed resources. Fees are charged for additional storage, bandwidth, or instance hours required by the application.[3] It was first released as a preview version in April 2008 and came out of preview in September 2011.
