<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system
or a private network inside a computer. Simply put, it is the unauthorised
<u>access</u> to or control over computer network security systems for some illicit purpose
Description: To better describe hacking, one needs to first understand hackers.
One can easily assume them to be intelligent and highly skilled in computers.
 In fact, breaking a security system requires more intelligence and expertise than actually creating one.
 There are no hard and fast rules whereby we can categorize hackers into neat compartments.

  Cloud computing is an information technology (IT) paradigm that enables ubiquitous access to shared pools of configurable system resources and higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the Internet. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, similar to a public utility.
