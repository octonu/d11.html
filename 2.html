<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system
or a private network inside a computer. Simply put, it is the unauthorised
<u>access</u> to or control over computer network security systems for some illicit purpose
Description: To better describe hacking, one needs to first understand hackers.
One can easily assume them to be intelligent and highly skilled in computers.
 In fact, breaking a security system requires more intelligence and expertise than actually creating one.
 There are no hard and fast rules whereby we can categorize hackers into neat compartments.

  Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon.com that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments, on a paid subscription basis. The technology allows subscribers to have at their disposal a full-fledged virtual cluster of computers, available all the time, through the Internet. AWS's version of virtual computers have most of the attributes of a real computer including hardware (CPU(s) & GPU(s) for processing, local/RAM memory, hard-disk/SSD storage); a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, CRM, etc. Each AWS system also virtualizes its console I/O (keyboard, display, and mouse), allowing AWS subscribers to connect to their AWS system using a modern browser. The browser acts as a window into the virtual computer, letting subscribers log-in, configure and use their virtual systems just as they would a real physical computer. They can choose to deploy their AWS systems to provide internet-based services for their own and their customers' benefit.
