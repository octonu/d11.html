<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system
or a private network inside a computer. Simply put, it is the unauthorised
<u>access</u> to or control over computer network security systems for some illicit purpose
Description: To better describe hacking, one needs to first understand hackers.
One can easily assume them to be intelligent and highly skilled in computers.
 In fact, breaking a security system requires more intelligence and expertise than actually creating one.
 There are no hard and fast rules whereby we can categorize hackers into neat compartments.
